    "you receive on or after you reach 59 , you receive because you became disabled (as defined in the Code), you receive from an immediate annuity, a Beneficiary receives on or after your death, or you receive as a series of substantially equal periodic payments based on your life or life expectancy (non-natural owners holding as agent for an individual do not qualify).\n",

This tax, which affects individuals whose modified adjusted gross income exceeds certain thresholds, is a 3.8% tax on the lesser of (i) the individual's “unearned income”, or (ii) the dollar amount by which the individual's modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold. Unearned income includes the taxable portion of distributions that you take from your annuity contract. If you take a distribution from your contract that may be subject to the tax, we will include a Distribution Code “D” in Box 7 of the Form 1099-R issued to report the distribution.
